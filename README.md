# Personal Build Your Own X

This is my personal collection of projects where I **build all sort of systems from scratch** â€” for learning, fun, and mastery. Inspired by the idea behind "Build Your Own X", but this is not a fork or clone of the original repo, it's just a bunch of learning processes.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each project lives in its own directory under the root of this repository. Each one is self-contained, with (generally) its own:

- `.gitignore`
- Codebase
- Build instructions

## âœ… Goals

- **Understand systems deeply** by recreating them
- Use minimal libraries and dependencies
- Emphasize clean code and architecture
- Document each project clearly

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

Each project has its own dependencies and instructions. See the `README.md` inside each project folder.
